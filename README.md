Recipedia, is a user friendly application that will allow users to search recipes and save them to their daily planner. The user will then be able to pick a recipe that calls out to them and add it to a daily schedule where they can plan their meals. 
For our spontaneous users we added a youtube video showing a video for a recipe based on what the user searched.
